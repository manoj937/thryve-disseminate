                    Angular uses these strategies to determine whether a child component should be checked while running change detection for a parent component. A strategy defined for a component impacts all child directives since they are checked as part of checking the host component. A defined strategy cannot be overridden in runtime.
</p>
<p>
    The default strategy, internally referred to as CheckAlways, implies regular automatic change detection for a component unless the view is explicitly detached. What’s known as OnPush strategy, internally referred to as CheckOnce, implies that change detection is skipped unless a component is marked as dirty. Angular implements mechanisms to automatically mark a component as dirty. When needed, a component can be marked dirty manually using markForCheck method exposed on ChangeDetectorRef.

</p>
<p>
When we define a strategy using @Component() decorator, Angular’s compiler records it in a component’s definition through the defineComponent function. For example, for the component like this:
                </p>
            </div>
         
    </div>
</div>
